Warmup and Debugging Exercise
-----------------------------
Q1. Is the first queue element displayed in debugger pane (element [0]) the element at front of queue or the back?  Is the first stack element displayed on the top of stack or the bottom?
A1: TODO


Q2: What must be true about the input to `duplicateNegatives` for it to produce correct output?
A2: TODO


Q3: For which type of inputs does `duplicateNegatives ` go into an infinite loop?
A3: TODO


Q4. What is the bug within `duplicateNegatives ` that causes it to get stuck in a loop?
A4: TODO


Q5: What is the state of the variables (as reported in the debugger variable pane) right 
before the removeMatchPair function crashes? What happens if you try to step over the line 
where the program crashes?
A5: TODO


Maze
-------
Q6. So far in this class, we've passed our data structures by reference. Why do you 
think `checkSolution` passes path by value instead of by reference?
A6: Check solution does not modify the path, but analyzes it's validity, so there is no need to pass it by reference.

Q7. After you have written your tests, describe your testing strategy to determine 
that your `checkSolution` works as intended.
A7: I might be mentioning this in an email to whomever it may concern, but I was completely unable to test becuase of inability to build the program in QT
"no rule to make target 'FunCollections'. Stop."
***^. Stop.
Furthermore, I tried to update and fix this bug to no avail, and lost all my saved code progress.

Q8. Describe the malformed maze files you created in order to verify the robustness 
of your maze reading.
A8: See question 7 answer.
